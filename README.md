Sine generator "Prevention".    The generator is designed to power the supplied coils developed by Alexander Mishin. Kit specifications The natural frequency of the coil is 300-310 kHz. The maximum current of the large coil is 250mA The maximum current of the small coil is 120mA. Radiation power adjustment range 25-100% Timer setting 15-60 min. Modulation frequencies - 174 285 396 417 528 631 741 852 963 Hz. Modulation depth 5-10%. The generator is powered by a 9V power supply. Power consumption no more than 3W. Turning on the generator.      Connect the power supply to the generator. The red No Generation LED should light up.   Connect the coil to the generator. Set the timer value in the range of 15-60 minutes (avoid the value "0").   Set the power value to an average level    Press the "Start" button. The yellow LED should light up, signaling the start of timing and start of the generator.   In the absence of faults and the presence of generation, the red LED "No generation" should go out.       Make the desired generator settings.  Warning !!!     According to Alexander Mishin, the method of therapy has wide popular recognition, but is not recognized by state medicine.      The methods of application are distributed by the author of the technique via the Internet. The manufacturer does not advise on the application.     Radiation power for a limited exposure time is not harmful to most adults.
